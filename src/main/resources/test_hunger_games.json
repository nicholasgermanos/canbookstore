The Capitol is harsh and cruel and keeps the districts in line by forcing them all to send one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV. \n\nSixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen regards it as a death sentence when she steps forward to take her sister's place in the Games. But Katniss has been close to dead before-and survival, for her, is second nature. Without really meaning to, she becomes a contender. \n\nBut if she is to win, she will have to start making choices that weigh survival against humanity and life against love.","featured_series":{"collection":null,"details":"1","featured":true,"id":6747,"position":1.0,"series":{"books_count":5,"id":1015,"name":"The Hunger

When sixteen-year-old Katniss learns that her little sister has been chosen, Kat steps up to fight in her place--and the games begin. This unathorized guide takes the reader behind the stage. The Hunger Games Companion includes fascinating background facts about the action in all three books, a revealing biography of the author, and amazing insights into the series' major themes and features--from the nature of evil, to weaponry and rebellions, to surviving the end of the world.

The promise of escape draws people from all backgrounds to speculative fiction, but when people of color seek passageways into the fantastic, the doors are often barred. This problem lies not only with children’s publishing, but also with the television and film executives tasked with adapting these stories into a visual world. When characters of color do appear, they are often marginalized or subjected to violence, reinforcing for audiences that not all lives matter. The Dark Fantastic is an engaging and provocative exploration of race in popular youth and young adult speculative fiction. Grounded in her experiences as YA novelist, fanfiction writer, and scholar of education, Thomas considers four black girl protagonists from some of the most popular stories of the early 21st century: Bonnie Bennett from the CW’s The Vampire Diaries, Rue from Suzanne Collins’s The Hunger Games, Gwen from the BBC’s Merlin, and Angelina Johnson from J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter. Analyzing their narratives and audience reactions to them reveals how these characters mirror the violence against black and brown people in our own world. In response, Thomas uncovers and builds upon a tradition of fantasy and radical imagination in Black feminism and Afrofuturism to reveal new possibilities. Through fanfiction and other modes of counter-storytelling, young people of color have reinvisioned fantastic worlds that reflect their own experiences, their own lives. As Thomas powerfully asserts, “we dark girls deserve more, because we are more.”","featured_series":{"collection":false,"details":null,"featured":true,"id":26584,"position":null,"series":{"books_count":15,"id":13238,"name":"Postmillenial Pop","primary_books_count":14,"slug":"postmillenial-pop"},"unreleased":false},"genres":["Fantasy","Young Adult","literary criticism"],"has_audiobook":true,"has_ebook":false,"id":"452028","image":{"color":"#547256","color_name":"Brown","height":145,"id":1167413,"url":"https://assets.hardcover.app/external_data/59408364/c3f3f8f9a7c484e7b07379c6a959ea28cff84347.jpeg","width":98},"isbns":["1494536064","9781494536060","1479806072","9781479806072","1479800651","9781479800650"],"lists_count":19,"moods":[],"pages":240,"prompts_count":0,"rating":4.428571428571429,"ratings_count":7,"release_date":"2019-01-01","release_year":2019,"reviews_count":2,"series_names":["Postmillenial Pop"],"slug":"the-dark-fantastic","subtitle":"Race and the Imagination from Harry Potter to the Hunger Games","tags":[],"title":"The Dark Fantastic: Race and the Imagination from Harry Potter to the Hunger Games","users_count":44,"users_read_count":12},"highlight":{"alternative_titles":[{"matched_tokens":["Hunger","Games"],"snippet":"The Dark Fantastic: Race and the Imagination from Harry Potter to the <mark>Hunger</mark> <mark>Games</mark>"},{"matched_tokens":[],"snippet":"The Dark Fantastic"}],"title":{"matched_tokens":["Hunger","Games"],"snippet":"The Dark Fantastic: Race and the Imagination from Harry Potter to the <mark>Hunger</mark> <mark>Games</mark>"}},"highlights":[{"field":"title","matched_tokens":["Hunger","Games"],"snippet":"The Dark Fantastic: Race and the Imagination from Harry Potter to the <mark>Hunger</mark> <mark>Games</mark>"},{"field":"alternative_titles","indices":[0],"matched_tokens":[["Hunger","Games"]],"snippets":["The Dark Fantastic: Race and the Imagination from Harry Potter to the <mark>Hunger</mark> <mark>Games</mark>"]}],"text_match":1157451471441100842,"text_match_info":{"best_field_score":"2211897868288","best_field_weight":5,"fields_matched":2,"score":"1157451471441100842","tokens_matched":2}},{"document":{"activities_count":0,"alternative_titles":["Anarchy: The Hunger Games for a New Generation"],"author_names":["Megan DeVos"],"compilation":false,"content_warnings":[],"contribution_types":["Author"],"contributions":[{"author":{"id":583362,"image":{},"name":"Megan DeVos","slug":"megan-devos"},"contribution":null}],"cover_color":"Brown","description":"THIRTY MILLION READERS WORLDWIDE.

The post-apocalyptic world of Panem's twelve districts is a divided society on the brink of war and struggling to survive, while the Capitol lives in the lap of luxury and pure contentment. At every turn in the Hunger Games trilogy, Katniss, Peeta, Gale, and their many allies wrestle with harrowing choices and ethical dilemmas that push them to the brink. Is it okay for Katniss to break the law to ensure her family's survival? Do ordinary moral rules apply in the Arena? Can the world of The Hunger Games shine a light into the dark corners of our world? Why do we often enjoy watching others suffer? How can we distinguish between what's Real and Not Real? This book draws on some of history's most engaging philosophical thinkers to take you deeper into the story and its themes, such as sacrifice, altruism, moral choice, and gender. Gives you new insights into the Hunger Games series and its key characters, plot lines, and ideas Examines important themes such as the state of nature, war, celebrity, authenticity, and social class Applies the perspective of some of world's greatest minds, such as Charles Darwin, Thomas Hobbes, Friedrich Nietzsche, Plato, and Immanuel Kant to the Hunger Games trilogy Covers all three books in the Hunger Games trilogy An essential companion for Hunger Games fans, this book will take you deeper into the dystopic world of Panem and into the minds and motivations of those who occupy it.","featured_series":{"collection":null,"details":"28","featured":true,"id":512581,"position":28.0,"series":{"books_count":25,"id":14755,"name":"Blackwell Philosophy and Pop
